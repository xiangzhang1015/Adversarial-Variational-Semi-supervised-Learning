## Overview
This repository contains reproducible codes for the proposed AVAE model.  
In this paper, we present an effective and robust semi-supervised latent representation framework, AVAE, by proposing a modified VAE model and integration with generative adversarial networks. The VAE++ and GAN share the same generator. In order to automatically learn the exclusive latent code, in the VAE++, we explore the latent codeâ€™s posterior distribution and then stochastically generate a latent representation based on the posterior distribution. The discrepancy between the learned exclusive latent code and the generated latent representation is constrained by semi-supervised GAN. The latent code of AVAE is finally served as the learned feature for classification.

## Datasets
All the datasets used in this paper are pretty large which are diffilut to upload to github. Fortunately, the datasets are public available and our paper basically used the raw data, so please access the original data in the following links.

PAMAP2: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring

TUH: https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml

MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Yelp: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

The datasets are huge, using small subset for debugging is strongly recommended. There are very detail comments in the code in order to help understanding.
