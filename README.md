# Adversarial-Variational-Semi-supervised-Learning
This is the reusable codes for KDD'19 research track paper: Adversarial Variational Embedding for Robust Semi-supervised Learning

Dependency:
Python == 2.7
TensorFlow == 1.3.0

There only three python files while the AVAE.py is the main file and others are the definition of related functions. 

All the datasets used in this paper are public available.
